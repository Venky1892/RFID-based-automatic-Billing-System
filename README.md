# RFID-based-automatic-Billing-System

This project implements an automated billing system using RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology to streamline the shopping and checkout process in retail environments.

## Key Features

- **Automated Product Scanning**: RFID tags on products are automatically scanned when added to or removed from the shopping cart.
- **Real-time Bill Calculation**: The system calculates and displays the total bill in real-time as products are added or removed.
- **LCD Display**: A 20x4 LCD screen shows product details, prices, and the current total bill.
- **Secure Payment**: Customers can pay using pre-charged cards provided by the store or through UPI (Unified Payments Interface).
- **SMS Notification**: The final bill is sent to the customer's registered mobile number via SMS.
- **Inventory Management**: The system automatically updates inventory as products are purchased.
- **Anti-theft Measures**: Built-in security features help prevent accidental or intentional product theft.

## Technology Stack
