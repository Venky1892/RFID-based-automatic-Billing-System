Today Problem:

Two primary issues with traditional shopping methods are addressed by the project:

## Issue 1: Time-consuming Checkout and Barcode Scanning

Only one product can be scanned at a time by the barcode scanning technology now in use in the majority of supermarkets and shopping centers. Customers and store employees both lose time as a result of the lengthy lines at checkout counters. For instance, it causes needless delays when a consumer with a single item must wait behind others with large carts.

## Issue 2: Having Trouble Pushing Bulky Shopping Trolleys

It takes physical work to push a traditional shopping cart, especially when it is full of goods. Customers who are old or physically disabled may find it difficult to move bulky carts throughout the store as a result.
In order to address these problems, the suggested smart shopping trolley system will:

1. Using RFID technology to provide automatic invoicing and quicker multi-item scanning.
2. Including the ability to move the trolley remotely so that patrons won't have to push it themselves.

These improvements are intended to drastically cut down on checkout times and increase the overall shopping experience for all consumers, especially those with limited mobility.
